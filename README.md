# KVM Backup Manager

A script for automating full VM backups and restores using KVM/QEMU on Linux.

## Features

- **Intuitive Menu Interface** - Easy-to-follow prompts
- **Complete VM Backups** - Captures both disk images and XML configurations
- **Flexible Restore** - Restore VMs with new names and storage locations
- **State Handling** - Automatically pauses/resumes running VMs during backup
- **Permission Management** - Handles both user and root-owned resources

## Requirements

- **KVM/QEMU** virtualization environment

### Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install libvirt-clients xmlstarlet qemu-utils
```

## Usage

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x kvm-backup-manager.sh
```

Run as regular user:

```bash
./kvm-backup-manager.sh
```

(The script will automatically request sudo when needed)

### Backup Workflow (Option 1)

- Select VM from list
- Choose backup location (default: `~/Desktop`)
- Script handles: shutdown -> copy -> startup
- Backup includes:
  - VM disk images
  - XML configuration file
  - Timestamped directory

### Restore Workflow (Option 2)

- Select backup directory
- Provide new VM name
- Specify disk storage location
- Script performs:
  - Generates new UUID
  - Creates MAC-free network config
  - Copies disks to new location
  - Registers VM with libvirt

### Important Notes

- **Disk Permissions**
  - Backups may require sudo for disk access
  - Restored disks will be owned by the current user
- **VM State**
  - Running VMs are gracefully shut down during backup
  - Original state is restored after backup completes
- **Storage**
  - Default backup location: `~/Desktop`
  - Default disk storage: `~/.local/share/libvirt/images`

### Contribution

Pull requests and issues welcome. Please ensure:

- Compatibility with standard KVM setups
- Script remains lightweight
- Error handling is preserved
